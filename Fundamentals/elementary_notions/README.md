## [A1] Heterogeneous Computing: Elementary Notions
Apan Qasem [\<apan@txstate.edu\>](mailto:apan@txstate.edu)

### Description

This module introduces fundamental concepts in heterogeneous computing. Notions of concurrency,
parallelism, and energy efficiency are discussed to explain the motivation  behind the move towards
heterogeneous processing. Different forms of heterogeneity are introduced including soft
heterogeneity (i.e., difference in core compute capabilities within a multicore system), CPU-GPU
heterogeneous execution and System-on-Chip (SoC) design. The module also covers heterogeneity 
in workloads and data with examples from cloud computing and mobile applications. The module concludes
with a discussion of available programming tools and performance challenges in heterogeneous
computing. 

### Context

This module is primarily intended for CS1/CS2 students. Although the module introduces parallel
computing concepts before moving on to processor heterogeneity, it is ideally suited for a course with some
coverage of parallel computing material. For example, a CS1 course that incorporates a PDC module
from [[1]](#csinparallel),[[2]](#cder), or [[3]](#tues). In the absence of PDC coverage, the length
of this module will need to be increased or it will need to be combined with a PDC module. 

### Topics

HC topics covered in this module are listed below. Bloom's classification is shown in brackets

  * Concurrency and Parallelism [K]
  * Multicore Processors [K]
  * GPU Acceleration [K]
  * System-on-Chip [K]

### Learning Outcomes

Having completed this module, students should be able to 

  * describe the differences between a homogeneous and a heterogeneous computing system
  * describe and distinguish between different forms of heterogeneity
  * understand the motivation behind the design of heterogeneous computing systems
  * recognize the importance of energy efficiency on current computing systems
