#### <a href="references"></a>Reference Material 

[ At the time of development ] there is no single resource that can serve as a good reference for all
concepts covered in this module. Furthermore, as yet, there is no definitive text on heterogeneous
computing. Below we list two books that cover fundamentals of heterogeneous computing and the
performance and programmability issues thereof. 

* David B. Kirk and W Hwu Wen-mei. Programming Massively Parallel Processors: A Hands-on Approach.
  Morgan Kaufmann, Third Edition, 2017, Morgan Kaufman / NVIDIA. (e-book available for free to qualified
  educators with [NVIDIA DLI](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/training/) Teaching Kits)

* Mohamed Zahran. Heterogeneous computing: Hardware and Software Perspectives, ACM Books, 2019
  (included [ACM DL](https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.1145/3281649) subscription).
