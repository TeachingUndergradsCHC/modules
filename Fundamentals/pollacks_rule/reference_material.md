## Resources for Further Reading on Pollack's Rule Module

This module was inspired by the following paper:

* T.Y. Morad, U.C. Weiser, A. Kolodny, M. Valero, and
  E. Ayguade. Performance, Power Efficiency and Scalability of
  Asymmetric Cluster Chip Multiprocessors. Computer Architecture
  Letters, 4(1):14-17, 2005. DOI: [10.1109/L-CA.2006.6](https://doi.org/10.1109/L-CA.2006.6)

which analyzes possible layouts of a chip multiprocessor under
different usage scenarios and shows that assymetric core sizes can
result in power savings.  (This is analygous to the calculations done
in the module except that they use power scaling to equalize the
performance.) 

That paper cites these discussions of Pollack's Rule:
* F.J. Pollack. New microarchitecture challenges in the coming
generations of CMOS process technologies. Keynote address at IEEE
Intern. Symp. Microarchitecture (MICRO), 1999.

I am not aware of a discussion of it in a textbook, but would be
interested in having one pointed out to me.
